# **Operational Analytics and Investigating Metric Spikes**  

## **Overview**  
Operational Analytics is a vital process that enables organizations to assess and enhance their end-to-end operations using data-driven insights. This project focuses on analyzing key business metrics, identifying trends, and investigating sudden fluctuations in performance indicators. By leveraging **Advanced SQL**, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that help improve decision-making across various departments such as **operations, support, and marketing**.  

The project consists of two major case studies:  
1. **Job Data Analysis** – Focuses on job review trends, throughput analysis, language distribution, and data quality assessment.  
2. **Investigating Metric Spikes** – Examines user engagement, growth, retention, device-based activity, and email interactions to understand key drivers of metric fluctuations.  

## **Business Problem**  
Organizations often experience **unexpected spikes or drops** in key performance indicators (KPIs), such as **user engagement, job review throughput, or email interactions**. These fluctuations can impact business decisions, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.  

### **Key Challenges:**  
1. **Identifying Trends:** Analyzing job review patterns and understanding their impact on productivity.  
2. **Investigating Anomalies:** Detecting sudden metric changes (spikes or drops) and determining root causes.  
3. **User Engagement & Retention:** Understanding how users interact with the platform and identifying areas for improvement.  
4. **Email Effectiveness:** Evaluating email engagement metrics to optimize communication strategies.  
5. **Operational Efficiency:** Ensuring data quality by detecting duplicate records and maintaining accurate reporting.  

### **Expected Impact:**  
By applying **Advanced SQL techniques**, the project aims to:  
✅ Enhance **operational efficiency** by tracking job reviews and analyzing workforce productivity.  
✅ Improve **customer experience** by identifying key drivers of engagement and retention.  
✅ Enable **data-driven decision-making** by providing clear insights into business performance.  
✅ Strengthen **email marketing effectiveness** by optimizing user communication strategies.  

This project provides a **systematic approach to operational analytics** by using SQL to extract meaningful insights and address real-world business challenges.
